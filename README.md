# Message-Passing-Interface-MPI-Basic
MPI establish a portable, efficient, and flexible standard for message passing that will be used for writing message-passing programs and communication among
processes, which have separate address spaces. A process is a program counter and address space. Each MPI process has its own global variables, environment,
and does not need to be thread-safe. A process is a copy of the program executed on every computer (node) in the network (cluster) where it is launched.
